"""
The function below interpolates between points on the PMM diagram to construct
the PM diagram for a given load point. It returns two lists which contain the
resultant moment and axial load for the points of the PM diagram at the lambda
for the given load point. 
Parameters: "mesh" is the quarter PMM mesh consisting of (Mx, My, P) points and
"point" is the load point in the form (P, Mx, My).
